## Inspiration
HEP -- During a volunteering session to help a local migrant shelter with the Housing Equity Club, we noticed that resources for the shelter are often geared towards opportunities for volunteers to help
(or externally linked to other volunteer websites). There is a lack of resources for the migrants themselves, which is what inspired us to create this project.

## What it does
This website provides information for migrants regarding legal assistance, job training, where to find food and shelter, and English learning resources, as well as for volunteers to find and
keep track of opportunities to help in their local area. Volunteers need to log in to save and view sessions they've signed up for on a calendar.

## How we built it
We used Django and Python to create applications for the website, such as the login and register pages, as well as a preliminary model for keeping track of nonprofit organizations which can provide resources
or opportunities to users. The design for each page of the page of the website was first marked up on paper and Google Slides, then implemented using HTML.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced obstacles with connecting the backend and frontend portions of the project, as well as getting over the learning curve for the unfamiliar tools we were learning. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We communicated openly with each other about bugs and other difficulties we ran into. Our team members offered feedback and assistance to each other throughout the project as well as during
periodic discussion sessions.

## What we learned
Our backend members learned to use the Django web development framework, while our frontend members learned to use HTML for the first time.

## What's next for Migrant Crisis Help
We hope to get more students involved with volunteering and make information on the website more accessible for people seeking shelter through implementing translations on each page for commonly
spoken languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin). We plan to add video/audio elements to make the help resources more accessible for people who may not be able to read.
